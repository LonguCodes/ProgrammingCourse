Our program, or rather the little parts we know how to write, are **linear** - whatever happens, the executed code will always be the same. That's a problem, because we want to alter the behavior depending on some conditions. 

**If**s are  a way to execute code on some condition.
```python
# Python
if 3 > 1 :
	#do something
```
With an **else** keyword we can extend the usefulness of ifs with action when the if is not passed.
```csharp
// C#
if(var_1 > var_2){
	// Executes if var_1 is greater var_2
}
else {
	// Executes if var_1 is lesser or equal var_2
}
```

We can use ifs and elses to create **mutually exclusive** conditions
```javascript
// Javascript
if(var_1 > var_2){
	// Executes if var_1  is greater var_2
}
else if (var_1  == var_2){
	// Executes if var_1  is the same as var_2
}
else{
	// Executes if none of the previous cases passed, so when var_1  is lesser than var_2
}
```
Ifs are great, but having an if that checks 10 or even more potential values of the same variable can be cumbersome. For that a better suited solution is a **switch**. It allows us to execute different actions depending on the the value of one variable.
```cpp
// C ++
int var_1 = 3;
switch (var_1){
	case 1:
		// Exectes when var_1 is equal to one
		break; // We need to add break at the end so it won't check every other case when this one passes
	case 3:
		// Executes when var_1 is equal to three
		break;
}
```

These control statements allow us to manipulate **if** something executes. The other features we will learn about allow us to specify  **how many times** something executes. We can groups these features into a category named **loops**.

The most basic loop is a **while** loop. It will execute it's body repetitively as long as the condition is met.
```java
// Java
int var_1 = 1;
while (var_1<5)  // Condition
{
	// The body od the loop. 
	// Do something
	var_1 *= 2;
}	
```
It also has a variation called **do while** loop. 
```c
int var_1 = 1;
do
{
	// The body od the loop. 
	// Do something
	var_1 *= 2;
}while (var_1<5)  // Condition
```
Difference between them lays in the time of checking the condition. While loops check **before body execution** and do while loops check **after body execution**.


One of the more sophisticated loops is a **for** loop. Besides the condition, it also has a **initialization** step and a **post-body** step. 

```javascript
// Javascript
var var_1 = 3;
for(var i = -3 ;i < 15; var_1 -=5) // Initialization ; condition ; post-body
{
	i = -2 * var_1;
}
```
Like the while loop, the for loop also check the condition **before** body execution. The initialization step happens before first check and the post-body step happens after every body execution.

The post-body step works exactly the same as a just adding if at the end of the body except for one case - when we use **loop control statements**. They consist of **continue** and **break**.

Continue allows us to **skip** the rest of the body in this cycle while break **exits** the loop without any more cycles.

```python
# Python
# Code summing every odd number from 1 to 10
var_1 = 0 
var_2 = 0
while True: # A infinite loop, because the contidion is always true
	var_1 += 1
	if var_1 % 2 == 0: # % is a modulo operator, also called the reminder in division
		continue
	var_2 += var_1
	if var_1 >= 10:
		break
```
A variation of the for loop is a **foreach** loop. Instead of being based on condition, it takes a value with a **iterator** and executes the body for every value that the iterator **yields**.
```csharp
// C#
int[] var_1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}; // Initialization of array with given values

foreach(int var_2 in var_1){
	// Executes for every value in var_1
}
```
We will talk about iterators and yielding more in future lessons, but for now think of them as basically a value with a indexers (eg. array)
