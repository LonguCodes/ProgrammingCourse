**Variables** in programming are like boxes with a sticker. They have 2 characteristics - the **value** and the **label**, also referred to as a **name**. 

```python
# Python
var_1 = 1
```

The value is the thing that is stored inside the box. As in the real world, **the box is never empty** - even if we say it is, it still has air inside (excluding boxes in the vacuum). Same goes in programming - there are no empty variables. If we want to mark the variable as empty, there is usually a **keyword** that means “empty”.

```ruby
# Ruby
var_1 = nil # this means empty
```

In **strongly-typed languages** like c++ or java, there is a 3rd characteristic of the variable: **type**. It signifies what can be put into the box, for example only tennis balls or cloths. The type has to be assigned on the **declaration** of the variable - the place where you also specify the name.

```csharp
// C#
int var_1 = 3; // Int is a type that "holds" number without decimal place 
```

Let’s now talk about declaration and it’s brother - **initialization**. Both are closely related and performed when you create a new variable. What are the differences? Declaration is the part that assigns a name in the programming language while initialization is the part when we actually link the name to some place in computer memory and places a value there. But let’s not worry about this for now.
```cpp
// C++
int var_1	 	= 4;
	^		^
	|		|
// declaration      initialization
```

  
Variables, as the name suggests, can **change the value** they are “holding”. It can be achieved by **assignment**, usually annotated by a “=” symbol. The old value that the variable was holding is deleted and cannot be recovered after assigning a new one.

```js
// Javascript
var var_1 = 4
var_1 = "test" 
```

If the language is strongly-typed, **the type of the value has to be the same as the type of the variable** (for example if we have a variable for storing numbers we can’t put a text value into it).

```rust
// Rust
let mut var_1: i32 = 6;
var_1 = "test" // Will error out becuase the variable's type (number without decimal place) is not compatibile with the new value's type (text)
```
