**Type** is a characteristic of a value and in strongly-typed languages also the variable, that defines how if behaves. Marking a variable with a certain type will enforce that this variable will only accept values of the same type, but even without it, the value stored still has a type.

Some types can be separated as **primitive**. It means that they are the atomic types of the language. Some of the primitive types are:
```java
// Java
int var_1 = 1; // Number without decimal place
float var_2 = 1.1; // Number with decimal place
char var_3 = 'a'; // ASCII character
boolean var_4 = false; // true/false value
```
Some languages also consider `string` (a chain of `char`s, used for text) and `pointer` (type for memory manipulation) a primitive types, but for our purposes they are complex (non-primitive) types.

**Numeric types** are the base way to represent numbers in programming. Most programming languages give you a option how much memory you want to allocate for the variable, and in consequence how big the number can be before the are problems.
For **decimal** types (**integer types**) we have:
```csharp
// C#
sbyte var_1 = 1; // values -128 - 127 
short var_2 = 2; // values -32,768 - 32,767
int var_3 = 3; // values -2,147,483,648 - 2,147,483,647
long var_4 = 4; // values -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 - 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
```
Each of them has a positive-only counterpart:
```csharp
// C#
byte var_1 = 1; // values 0 - 255
ushort var_2 = 2; // values 0 - 65,535
uint var_3 = 3; // values 0 - 4,294,967,295
ulong var_4 = 4; // values 0 - 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
```

There are also types for representing numbers with a **decimal place**, also called **floating point types**
```cpp
// C++
float var_1 = 1.1; // 32-bit 
double var_2 = 2.2; // 64-bit 
```
We can't give exact minimal and maximal values (we can but they are meaningless) because of how floating point types are represented internally. They won't be exactly accurate and the closer we go to the limit, the less accurate they are. That's why it's usually better to use integer types, which do not have this limitation.

Regardless of the presence of decimal place, every numeric type can **overflow**, which is an effect achieved by trying to store to big of a number in a type that doesn't have enough capacity. The result of overflowing is "looping" of the value in the range of representable numbers. 
```rust
// Rust
let var_1:u8 = 255 + 1; // Will result in 0, because u8 (positive-only short with range 0-255) is not big enough to store 256, so the next value in looping range (0) will be used
```
