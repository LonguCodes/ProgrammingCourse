**Type** is a characteristic of a value and in strongly-typed languages also the variable, that defines how if behaves. Marking a variable with a certain type will enforce that this variable will only accept values of the same type, but even without it, the value stored still has a type.

Some types can be separated as **primitive**. It means that they are the atomic types of the language. Some of the primitive types are:
```java
// Java
int var_1 = 1; // Number without decimal place
float var_2 = 1.1; // Number with decimal place
char var_3 = 'a'; // ASCII character
boolean var_4 = false; // true/false value
```
Some languages also consider `string` (a chain of `char`s, used for text) and `pointer` (type for memory manipulation) a primitive types, but for our purposes they are complex (non-primitive) types.

**Numeric types** are the base way to represent numbers in programming. Most programming languages give you a option how much memory you want to allocate for the variable, and in consequence how big the number can be before the are problems.
For **decimal** types (**integer types**) we have:
```csharp
// C#
sbyte var_1 = 1; // values -128 - 127 
short var_2 = 2; // values -32,768 - 32,767
int var_3 = 3; // values -2,147,483,648 - 2,147,483,647
long var_4 = 4; // values -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 - 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
```
Each of them has a positive-only counterpart:
```csharp
// C#
byte var_1 = 1; // values 0 - 255
ushort var_2 = 2; // values 0 - 65,535
uint var_3 = 3; // values 0 - 4,294,967,295
ulong var_4 = 4; // values 0 - 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
```

There are also types for representing numbers with a **decimal place**, also called **floating point types**
```cpp
// C++
float var_1 = 1.1; // 32-bit 
double var_2 = 2.2; // 64-bit 
```
We can't give exact minimal and maximal values (we can but they are meaningless) because of how floating point types are represented internally. They won't be exactly accurate and the closer we go to the limit, the less accurate they are. That's why it's usually better to use integer types, which do not have this limitation.

Regardless of the presence of decimal place, every numeric type can **overflow**, which is an effect achieved by trying to store to big of a number in a type that doesn't have enough capacity. The result of overflowing is "looping" of the value in the range of representable numbers. 
```rust
// Rust
let var_1:u8 = 255 + 1; // Will result in 0, because u8 (positive-only short with range 0-255) is not big enough to store 256, so the next value in looping range (0) will be used
```



**Boolean type**, also called **bool**, is used to represent true/false values. It is also the result of any comparative operation.
```python
# python
var_1 = 1 > 5 # The variable will hold "False" value
```

**Char** is a variant of byte, which is interpreted as a character rather than a number, but under the hood they are exactly the same. In fact, most languages allow you to convert them both ways and some even will treat them the same out of the box.
```haskell
-- haskell
let var_1 = 'a' -- char literals are represented in single quotes
```
All the types we talked about are one-value types, but sometimes we need to store a series of values. For that purpose we have vast number of different **series types**, most basic of which is an **array**. It is a fixed-length series of values with an **indexer** - way of accessing these values inside the array. It is usually differentiated by square brackets. In most programming languages the enumeration of variables in array starts at **0**.
```C
// C
int[3] var_1; // Creates a array of 3 values, every one of type int
var_1[1] // We can access the values of array using square brackes and the array name. [1]  represents the 2nd value - enumeration starts at 0
var_1[2] = 3; // The access is a read-write access
var_1[3] = 17; // If we try to access a value with an index outside of array, we will get an error
```
Arrays are fast and neat, but they are usually not as flexible as other solutions. We will talk about them in future lessons. 

We can also create our own types. There are a lot of ways scattered around in different languages to achieve this, but we will focus on the most simple one - a **structure**, also called a **struct**. 
Not every language supports structs, some only supports  **classes**, which are (I hope more advanced users will forgive me for this simplification) basically structs with extra capabilities, or other type-creation ways. Nevertheless we will focus only on structs.
```haskell
-- Haskell
data CustomType = CustomType {
	var_1 :: Int,
	var_2 :: Double
}
```
Structs are just a **composition of variables**. They work exactly the same as creating multiple variables, but allow us to restructure and organize our variables (for the most part). They are use exactly the same as any other type.
```csharp
// C#
struct CustomType {
	int var_1;
	double var_2;
}

CustomType var_3;
```
Structs don't have literals, so have to be initialized in other way. Unfortunately this differs from language to language, so we will not tackle this in this course.
To access **fields** - variables inside struct (and any other non-primitive data type) we use **member access operator**. It is represented differently in different languages, but usually it's achieved by `.` (a dot) followed by the name of the field.
```python
# Python

# Struct are not easily achieved in python, let's just assume we have the same struct and variable from previous example

var_3.var_1 = 1
var_3.var_2 = 2.2
```

What we talked about is only the tip of the iceberg, both in terms of other types and information about the types I described. We will talk about certain type families in further chapters.
