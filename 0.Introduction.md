This course is supposed to teach you programming, not c++ or python, so it will not be focused on one language. Instead there will be a lot of different languages. Every code example will be presented in code blocks and denoted what language is used like this
```python 
# python
```
```cpp
// C++
```
```haskell
-- Haskell
```
Additional information inside the code block will be inside a comment. For now just know, that comments are a way of adding information without changing the execution of the program - or in another way, they are purely visual. More on comments will be later.

Some of the information that is present here may not apply to your specific language, but it should to most languages and quick google search will tell you if it exists in your language and how to make it work.
