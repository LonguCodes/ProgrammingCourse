Programming languages allow us to perform **operations** on values, like addition, comparison, assignment etc. To use an operation we specify that by using an **operator**.


```java
// Java 
int var_1 = 3 * 5;
```

Operators can be split into two groups: **unary** and **binary**. 

Unary operators are ones that take one value and return another value, for example a negation operator `-` (not to be mistaken with the subtraction operator denoted with the same character). 

```ts
// Typescript 
var var_1:number = 1
var var_2:number = -var_1 // Equal to -1;
```

Binary operators are placed between 2 values and return the value of the operation, for example multiplication `*`.
```haskell
-- Haskell
let var_1 = 3 + 5 -- Equal to 8
```

Operators also have **priority** which determines which ones are applied first. The order can be changed with parentheses `( )`.
```c
// C
int var_1 = 3 * 5 + 7; // Equal to 22
int var_2 = 3 * (5 + 7); // Equal to 36
```

**Division** is a special operation in programming, because there are actually 2 different divisions - floating and integer. They have different denotation in different languages, so inside code block (outside comments) I will use the one that is appropriate for the language and comment which one it is.
Floating division is one that can result in a **float** - number with a decimal place. I will mark it as `/` (outside of non-comment code). 
Integer division results in an **integer** - number without a decimal place. The floating point from the result is cut off. I will mark it as `//` or `div` (outside of non-comment code). 

**Binary operators** allow us to perform binary operations on variables and values. They are incredibly fast because they correspond directly to what processor actually does under the hood. 
```c#
// C#
int var_1 = ~60 // Binary not. Results in -61
int var_2 = 4|3 // Binary or. Results in 7
int var_3 = 7&11 // Binary and. Results in 3
int var_4 = 7^11 // Binary xor. Results in 4
int var_5 = 3<<5 // Binary move left. Works like 3 * 2^5. Results in 96
int var_6 = 48>>3 // Biary move right. Works like 48 // 2^3. Results in 6
```
**Comparative operators** are another kind of operators that are used to, well, compare 2 values and result in `True`/`False` value.
```py
# Python
var_1 = 1 > 2 # Greater. Results in False
var_2 = 1 < 2 # Lower. Results in True
var_3 = 1 >= 2 # Greater or equal. Results in False
var_4 = 1 <= 2 # Lower or equal. Results in True
var_5 = 1 == 2 # Equal. Results in False
var_6 = 1 != 2 # Not equal. Results in True	
```

**Logical operators** are usually used in combination with comparative operators. They allow us to combine `True`/`False` values.
```js
// Javascript
var var_1 = true || false // Logical or. Results in true
var var_2 = true && false // Logical and. Results in false
```

**Assign operator** was already talked about in this course, but let's return to it, because it actually can combine with other operators for a cleaner code.
```rust
// Rust
let mut var_1 = 1;
var_1 += 1; // Adds one to var_1. The same as var_1 = var_1 + 1
var_1 -= 1; // Subtracts one from var_1. The same as var_1 = var_1 - 1
var_1 *= 2; // Multiplies var_1 by two. The same as var_1 = var_1 * 2
var_1 /= 2; // Divides var_1 by 2. The same as var_1 = var_1 / 2
``` 
It can also be combined in similar way with `|` , `&` and `^` (and probably others that I don't remember).

We will talk more about operators throughout the course while we need them.
